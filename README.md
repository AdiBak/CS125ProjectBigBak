## Project Overview

Big Bak is a context-aware recommendation system designed to help young adults manage everyday necessities and shopping needs. The system proactively suggests items users may need based on their personal habits, inventory history, and real-world context such as location and recent activities.

### Problem Statement

Many young adults struggle to stay organized with daily necessities like groceries, clothing, and hygiene products, especially when transitioning to independent living. Busy schedules and limited mental bandwidth often lead to forgotten items, inefficient last-minute trips, or running out of essentials at inconvenient times. Existing solutions require high levels of proactive effort that many users find difficult to maintain.

### Solution

Our system provides a personalized, context-aware recommendation engine that:
- Tracks user inventory and consumption patterns
- Uses location data to identify shopping opportunities
- Proactively suggests items based on predicted needs
- Considers user preferences (brands, price sensitivity, dietary needs)
- Provides timely, actionable recommendations without requiring manual list-making

### Target Users

Young adults (students and early-career professionals) who:
- Manage busy, fast-paced routines
- Regularly shop for groceries and essentials
- Often forget items or make unplanned trips
- Would benefit from lightweight, proactive shopping support

## Key Features

- **Personal Modeling**: Captures user preferences, favorite brands, dietary needs, and shopping habits
- **Inventory Tracking**: Monitors products owned and predicts when items need restocking
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Considers location, time, recent activities, and proximity to stores
- **Smart Ranking**: Prioritizes recommendations based on urgency, convenience, and user preferences

## Use Case Example

A user finishes a workout and walks past a grocery store. Based on their location, recent activity, and inventory data, the system recognizes they're running low on milk and protein powder. It sends a notification with nearby store options and reasoning, allowing the user to quickly decide whether to stop in.
